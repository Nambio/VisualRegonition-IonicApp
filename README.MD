# visual-recognition-ionic

Application that uses a REST API based on a Node JS Server.

The user uploads an image from the camera of his device to the Node JS Server.

Then the Node JS Server uses IBM Visual Recognition API to send a JSON Response to the Ionic Application.

The Ionic Application displays to the user the confidence and the class of the image from the previous JSON Response.
